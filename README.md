# NHL 94 Genesis

Bitwise rebuild of NHL 94 for the Sega Genesis. The segment pass has not started.

The listing is `lst/nhl94.bin.lst`. The ROM it was generated from is `lst/nhl94.bin`. That file is the reference for every segment verify. Do not use a different ROM.

The listing is an IDA LST in ASM68K / MRI mode. It has no address column. `loc_` / `sub_` names are the address.

Style source for a segment is the matching file in [NHLPA93Genesis](https://github.com/abdulahmad/NHLPA93Genesis).

## Segment queue

`src/hockey94.asm` is the include list. `SEGMENT_AGENT.md` is the rule file. `PROMPT.md` is the first Copilot prompt. Placeholder files are comments only.

94-only files that 93 did not have:

- `attract94.asm` for `EASportsScreen`, `HiScoreScreen`, and `LoadDefMenuOptions`
- `sram94.asm` starts at `InitSaveRAM`

## Build

Segment builds use `buildseg.bat` and `npm run seg:<name>` once a segment has a stub and a confirmed org. Verify against `lst/nhl94.bin`.

`npm run extractassets` runs `extractAssets94.js` against `lst/nhl94.bin`. That is for the graphics and sound data pass, not for the code segments.

The full `npm run build:retail` path is not ready. It still points at `src/hockey94.asm`, which is the queue.
